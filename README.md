*UDSSL Time Tracker* helps you to **precisely** track your time. *Charts* allows
you to **visualize** how your time is spent and helps you to be more productive.


### Description

*UDSSL Time Tracker* helps you to track your time easily with *an intutive interface*. You
can easily track your time *with a few clicks*. Using presets you can track frequent tasks instantly.

### Payment Tracker

*Payment Tracker* allows you to keep a record of your earnings. Once the payment
is assigned to a task, that particular task is removed from time tracker interface
select boxes. *You can't record time for a paid task*. You should start a new
task for new work.

### JSON API

UDSSL Time Tracker front interface is built as a **Backbone JS** application. Backbone app uses the
JSON API to manage your time data. The **JSON API** is restricted to logged-in users by default. You can use the API in any
other custom plugin as a logged in user. Further, you can make the API public and
*use it remotely* if required. [Read about the other technologies used][2].
